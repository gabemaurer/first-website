## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Be Natural
You don't need perfect grammar. AI understands:
- ✅ "make clip 2 slower"
- ✅ "slow down clip 2"
- ✅ "add slow motion to second clip"
- ✅ "slow-mo on clip #2"

All work the same!

### 2. Chain Commands
Execute multiple commands in sequence:
```
1. "fade to all clips" → Execute
2. "make it vibrant" → Execute
3. "slow motion on clip 3" → Execute
```

### 3. Use Time References
When you know exact times:
```
"slow motion at 0:15"
"fade at 0:30"
"speed up at 1:20"
```

AI finds the right clip automatically!

### 4. Experiment
Try different phrasings:
- "brighten it up" = vibrant filter
- "old school look" = vintage filter
- "dramatic effect" = slow motion + b&w
- "energize it" = speed up

### 5. Check History
Your last 5 commands show below the input box. Great for:
- Remembering what you did

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Command not recognized"
**Cause:** AI couldn't understand the command

**Try:**
- Use simpler words: "slow motion" instead of "decelerate"
- Specify the clip: "clip 2" or "at 0:15"
- Check examples above

**Need help?** Type commands like the examples - AI learns from these patterns!

### "No clips to apply to"
**Cause:** Timeline is empty or clip not found

**Fix:**
- Add clips to timeline first
- Check clip numbers (clip 1, not clip 0)
- Make sure time exists in video

### Command didn't work as expected
**Cause:** AI interpreted differently

**Try:**
- Be more specific: "clip 2" instead of "the middle one"
- Use exact time: "at 0:15" instead of "around 15 seconds"
- Check current effects first

## 💬 Natural Language Tips

AI understands context and variations:

**Instead of memorizing exact phrases:**
```
❌ Must use: "add_slow_motion_clip_2"
```

**Just talk naturally:**
```
✅ "make clip 2 slower"
✅ "slow down the second one"
✅ "add slow-mo to #2"
✅ "clip 2 needs to be slower"
```

**All work because AI understands:**
- Synonyms (slow motion = slow-mo = slow down)
- Context (clip 2 = second clip = #2)
- Intent (wants slow motion effect)

## 🎯 Command Success Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "clip 2" is better than "that one"
2. **Use Numbers**: "at 0:15" is better than "around there"
3. **One Action**: Do one thing per command
4. **Check Results**: Preview after each command
5. **Experiment**: Try different ways to say things

## 📱 Mobile Command Tips

On mobile, use the command box for speed:

**Faster than tapping:**
- "fade all" → Faster than tapping each clip
- "vibrant filter" → Faster than menu navigation
- "slow-mo clip 3" → Faster than finding clip and button

**Voice Input (if enabled):**
Some mobile browsers support voice:
1. Tap microphone in keyboard
2. Say your command
3. Tap Execute
